>This scope also enables a special syntax within the seeds list for adding SURT prefixes separate from seeds. Any line in the seeds list beginning with a '+' will be considered a SURT prefix specification, rather than a seed. Any URL you put after the '+' will only be used to deduce a SURT prefix -- it will not be independently scheduled. You can also put your own literal SURT prefix after the '+'.
